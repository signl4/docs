# SIGNL4 Integration with puq

[puq.ai](https://puq.ai/) is an AI-powered workflow automation platform that lets teams connect apps and automate repetitive business tasks without code. It offers a visual builder, smart triggers, real-time monitoring, and integrations with hundreds of services to create end-to-end automations that boost productivity and reduce manual work.

SIGNL4 adds reliable mobile alerting to puq via app push notifications, SMS text messages, or voice calls. It also supports escalations, on-call scheduling, and team collaboration.

SIGNL4 is available as a native integration in puq. Simply add the appropriate SIGNL4 action to your flow wherever reliable mobile alerting is required.

## Prerequisites

- A [SIGNL4](https://www.signl4.com/) account
- A [puq](https://puq.ai/) account

## How to Integrate

Integrating SIGNL4 into your puq workflow is straightforward. Simply insert the appropriate SIGNL4 action – such as "Trigger Alert" – into your puq workflow. You can find more information about the integration and supported actions [here](https://puq.ai/integrations/signl4).

All you need is a SIGNL4 API key, which you can generate in the SIGNL4 web portal under Integrations -> API Keys.

## Test it

That is it. Now you can save the workflow and test it. You should then receive an alert on your SIGNL4 app.

The alert in SIGNL4 might look like this.
