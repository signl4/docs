# SIGNL4 Integration with NetApp Cloud Insights

[NetApp Cloud Insights](https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-insights) is a hybrid monitoring service capable of monitoring not only on-prem servers but also Azure and AWS installations. Performance monitors are easy to configure, and notifications channels are configured with just a few clicks.  SIGNL4 ensures that all on duty members receive, acknowledge and resolve critical alerts, all from their smartphones. With persistent notifications and escalation chains there will never be a critical alert that goes unattended. SIGNL4 also offers ad-hoc collaboration between team members for each alert, so Subject Matter Experts can be looped in to help resolve issues.

In our example we are using NetApp Cloud Insights to monitor the performance of Azure Virtual Machines.  The on-duty team members will be alerted via Push, SMS and Voice from the email generated within Cloud Insights.

SIGNL4 is a mobile alert notification app for powerful alerting, alert management and mobile assignment of work items.  Get the app at [https://www.signl4.com](https://www.signl4.com/)
