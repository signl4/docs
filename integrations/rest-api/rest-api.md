# SIGNL4 REST API

SIGNL4 offers a comprehensive REST API for interacting and performing various tasks and configurations. You can find a detailed description of the REST API [here](https://connect.signl4.com/api/docs/index.html?urls.primaryName=SIGNL4%20API%20V2).

**Attention**: If you plan to send (trigger) alert, you can use the [outbound webhook API](https://docs.signl4.com/integrations/webhook/webhook.html#signl4-integration-with-webhook). This offers a simple yet powerful way to trigger alerts by sending HTTP POST requests.
