# SIGNL4 Integration with Autotask

You can configure the Autotask integration with SIGNL4 as follows.

## Connector App (Two-Way)

This is the recommended approach offering two-way integration of SIGNL4 with Datto (Kaseya) Autotask.

The Autotask connector app makes 2-way integration with Autotask a child's play and responding to service desk tickets can be done conveniently via the SIGNL4 mobile app.

Feature overview
- Forwarding tickets of your choice to SIGNL4
- Status synchronization between both systems
- Agent assignment when Signl is acknowledged and or closed
- Ticket notes on status changes in SIGNL4

## How does it work?
The connector communicates using the Autotask REST API to read ticket details or to update them. An API user with according permissions must be used and created in Autotask. The following permissions are required: Tickets (view, edit), Companies (view), Contacts (view), and Ticket Notes (view, add, edit). Please note that the Companies entity might also be referred to as Accounts or Contracts.

You can install and configure the integration in the SIGNL4 web portal under Integrations -> Gallery -> Autotask (please make sure to select the two-way integration here <- / -> ).

Here you need to configure your Autotask API username and secret with sufficient access rights. You can find more information [here](https://www.autotask.net/help/Content/4_Admin/1CompanySettings_Users/ResourcesUsersHR/Resources/API_User_Add_Edit.htm). The other parameters are optional, and you can find more information when hovering over the (?) symbol of the according item.
