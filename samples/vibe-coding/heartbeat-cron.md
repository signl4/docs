# Vibe Coding with SIGNL4

Vibe coding (or AI vibe coding) refers to a relaxed, exploratory approach to programming where a developer collaborates with an AI assistant (like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot) to write and refine code in a conversational, improvisational way. Instead of strictly following a plan, the process is driven by curiosity, experimentation, and rapid feedback, making coding feel more like a creative dialogue than a rigid task.

# Add SIGNL4 mobile alerting using an AI prompt

To add SIGNL4 mobile alerting using an AI prompt, you typically use an AI agent, assistant, or automation builder capable of issuing HTTP requests or integrating via webhook API. The AI tool receives an instruction like this:

```
Send a SIGNL4 alert using the SIGNL4 webhook API.
```

The AI tool interprets your prompt and responds by constructing and executing an HTTP request to the SIGNL4 webhook API, effectively triggering a mobile alert.

You can use this workflow in AI chat tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Grok to generate code snippets. Additionally, these prompts can be used directly within IDEs or no-code / low-code platforms such as Buildship, GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, Replit, or String by Pipedream to build more advanced and automated alerting solutions.

You can find an example using Replit [here](https://docs.signl4.com/integrations/replit/replit.html).

The alert in SIGNL4 might look like this.
