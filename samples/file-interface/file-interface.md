# SIGNL4 File Interface

This sample code demonstrates how to trigger automated alerts in SIGNL4 by reading incident or event data from a file (e.g., CSV or TXT). It’s ideal for systems that don’t support webhooks or APIs. Simple file operations can trigger mobile alerts, making it useful for legacy systems and custom scripts.

The full sample code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/signl4/signl4-file-interface).
