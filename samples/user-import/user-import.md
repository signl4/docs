# SIGNL4 User Import

Inviting a lot of users to SIGNL4 might be time consuming. 

To make this task easier we provide PowerShell scripts to help importing and inviting users to SIGNL4.

You just need to provide a .csv file with the user's email address, the team name and role. The scripts will to the rest, read the file import the users and SIGNL4 will automatically send all the invitation emails to the users.

You can find a complete description along with the scripts and a sample .csv file [here](https://github.com/signl4/signl4-userimport/tree/main).
